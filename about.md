Hiya, I'm Emil, a fourteen year old high-school freshman, born June 2nd, 2003, in Kangasala, Finland, that lives now in Cincinnati, OH, and welcome to my school blog titled Lime School. I go to Turpin High School, and I'm currently taking Pre-AP English 9, which requires us to have a school dedicated blog to publish some of our work on.
